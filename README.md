# MEAN (GRR) Stack [![MIT license](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-lightgrey.svg)](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This application can be used to keep track of cats and users. By using the MEAN stack you can see who has registered, what cats are logged into the system and add more cats. 
Basically if you love cats you will love this.

To use: Add a cat by clicking "Cats" at the top. Scroll down to the bottom and add your cat to the database. 
Then to register click "Register" and use any e-mail and password you wish (it can be fake if you'd like).
